This HTML code snippet creates a simple web page for a Deposit Calculator application. Users can input the deposit amount (Sum), the term in days (Term in days), the interest rate in percentage (The interest rate in %), and select whether capitalization applies (Capitalization).

Upon submitting the form, the submitData(event) function in index.js is triggered to calculate the interest based on the provided inputs. The result is dynamically displayed on the page within the <div class="result"></div> section.

The page uses basic styling defined in styles.css and incorporates the Google Fonts library (Fira Sans) for typography.

This setup allows users to calculate deposit interest quickly and efficiently directly from their web browser.
